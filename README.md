## App Title

The Dental Hub

## Description

This is an application where Dental personnel can submit their patients dental prostheses (such as dentures/partials/crowns) and keep track of when prostheses are sent to the lab, sent back to the clinic, resent to the lab, and when they are delivered to the patient. Allows an easier flow of keeping record of dental prostheses.
